## Simple Summary

Deploy the Soft Protocol Smart Contracts on to the Base network.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SEP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SEP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

The Base network is being used by many users of SOFT smart contracts. A deployment on the Base chain would be of benefit to the community and the users of the software.

## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SEP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SEP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is innaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SEP will address the issue!-->

There is demand from community members to receive tokens on Base and from projects fundraising on Base.

## Specification

<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

### Overview

<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the SEP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->

This SEP is not a technical change, just a proposal to launch the contracts of Soft Protocol onto Base.

### Rationale

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

The contracts will be deployed on the Base network, including the Sale and Claims contracts.


### Technical Specification

<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces Soft currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->
